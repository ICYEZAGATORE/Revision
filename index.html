        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
          </li>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying</li>

        <h1>JavaScript and Java</h1>
        <p>
          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
          different in some others.
        </p>

      <div class="content" id="hello-world">
        <h1>Hello world</h1>
        <code

      <div class="content" id="variables">
        <h1>Variables</h1>
        <p>
          You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
          The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content" id="declaring-variables">
        <h2>Declaring variables</h2>
        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
        <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
        <code>var x = 42.</code>
        <p>
          This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
        </p>
        <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
        <code>x = 42.</code>
        <p>
          This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict
          JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
        </p>
        <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
        <code>let y = 13.</code>
        <p>
          This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
          Variable scope below.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content" id="variable-scope">
        <h2>Variable scope</h2>
        <p>
          When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
          global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
          current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
          called a local variable, because it is available only within that
          function.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
          rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function
          (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the
          following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or
          global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in
          this case is an if statement.
        </p>
        <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
        <p>
          This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
          ECMAScript 2015.
        </p>
        <code
          >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
          defined</code
        >
      </div>
      <div class="content" id="global-variables">
        <h2>Global variables</h2>
        <p>
          Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
          pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
          variables using the window.variable syntax.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
          or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
          frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared
          in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
          parent.phoneNumber.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="content" id="Constants">
        <h2>Constants</h2>
        <p>
          You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
          syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
          identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
          can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
        </p>
        <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
        <p>
          A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
          while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
          scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
          assumed to represent a variable.
        </p>
        <p>
          You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
          variable in the same scope. For example:
        </p>
        <code
          >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
          WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
          //statements }</code
        >
        <p>
          However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
          statement is executed without problems.
        </p>
        <code
          >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
        </code>
      </div>
    </main>
  </body>
